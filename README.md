# Financial Market Analysis

## Abstract
Financial Markets represent a type of time-series data that exhibits both seasonality and trend, requiring cumulation of multiple statistical approaches for machine learning modeling. The goal of our project is to analyze financial timeseries datasets obtained from independent market sources such as Yahoo! Finance to build prediction models using supervised learning techniques such as linear regression, logistical regression, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Supervised feature engineering for feature selection using LASSO regularization and comparing its performance against ridge regression is also a goal of the project.
